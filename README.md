# Picture-Sorter
This in-progress personal project attempts to create a tool to help sort all of your pictures and video through a command line and GUI interfaces.

The project takes an "unsorted" directory of media, and allows them to place media quickly and efficiently into directories within a "sorted" directory. 
The GUI version creates a window which displays the current image to sort, has a text entry element with autocomplete suggestions of exisiting "sorted" directories and the create new directory option, and buttons for skipping, deleting, or copying a photo into multiple "sorted" directories. The user can use the tab or arrow keys to quickly select the top autocomplete option or recall previosuly used directories respectfully.

The command line version uses yes/no prompts and user commands to sort media into the directory with the closest match to the user input, create new directories, and skip and delete "unsorted" files. This version displays media with the Windows Media Player.
